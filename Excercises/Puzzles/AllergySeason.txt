Puzzle No. 6, Allergy Season:
Five friends (Allegra, Ben, Clara, Flora, and Zach) are each allergic to something different: pollen, shellfish, bee stings, cats, or nuts.
	·	Allegra has a food allergy
	·	Ben can play with his kitten for hours without issue (or medicine).
	·	Clara’s allergy is not related to animals.
	·	Flora has seasonal allergies.

Allegra >>> Shellfish
Ben >>> Bee Stings
Calara >>> Nuts
Flora >>> Pollen
Zach >>> Cats





	➢	Allegra has a food Allergy. This means we have two probabilities we should think of, which are Shellfish and Nuts. Filling the table with 1 for both then later we will Eliminate the other inappropriate probability
	➢	Eliminating Cats for Ben, since he can play with them without issue. (Put 0 in the table)
	➢	Eliminating Shellfish, Bee stings, and Cats for Clara
	➢	Clara probabilities are Pollen and Nuts
	➢	Since Flora has seasonal Allergies, this means its Pollen .. which let us know we’re left with Nuts for Clara.
	➢	Eliminate Nuts Allergy for Allegra (Delete the zero we’ve put earlier), Allegra has Shellfish allergy.
	➢	Now for Cats Allergy, we are left with Zach
	➢	Ben is left with Bee Stings
