The Good Life

Each of five neighborhood dogs (Saber, Ginger, Nutmeg, Pepper, and Bear) is enjoying one of the following activities: getting its ears scratched, playing catch, taking a nap, burying a chew toy, and going for a walk.
	•	Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy.
	•	Neither Ginger nor Saber nor Bear is on a walk.
	•	One of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched.
	•	A dog not named for a spice is playing catch.
	•	Bear is getting some exercise.
Can you figure out what each pooch is doing?

Ginger >>> Ears scratched
Bear >>> Playing catch
Saber >>> Taking a nap
Pepper >>> Burying chew toy
Nutmeg >>> Going for a walk

Solution
	•	Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy but since another rule is “a dog not named for a spice is playing catch”, he is therefore burying a chew toy.
	•	There are 3 activities that constitute exercise- playing catch, burying chew toy and going for a walk. Since Bear is getting some exercise but is not on a walk or burying a chew toy, he is thus playing catch.
	•	Since Ginger, Saber, Bear and Pepper are not on a walk, that leaves Nutmeg who is going for a walk.
	•	Ginger is the only dog left named after a spice, so thus Ginger is getting its ears scratched.
	•	That leaves Saber with the only option of taking a nap.
