Solution Details:
	➢	I started with figuring out who are Dads and Who are Grads
	➢	3 Dads, 3 Grads
	➢	Stephanie is definitely not a Dad .. so she is a Grad
	➢	Since Stephanie went to prom with Michael’s son, then she’s is not the daughter of Michael
	➢	Elias & James are the other 2 Grads because they played on the school basketball team
	➢	Elias & James one of them is Alberto’s Son, So eliminate Stephanie from being related to him
	➢	Since neither Michael nor Alberto are related to Stephanie, she’s only left with 1 choice .. Ken is her father
	➢	Michael & Elias are not related, means Michael is not the father of Stephanie nor Elias
	➢	Michael is the father of James
	➢	Alberto is the Father of Elias
