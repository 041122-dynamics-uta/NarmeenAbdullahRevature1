The Long and the Short of It

Here’s a great logic puzzle for kids: Six neighborhood children (Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina) were measured yesterday.
	•	Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.
	•	Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.
	•	Benito is not the shortest.
Can you put them in order of height from tallest to shortest?


	
1 - shortest
2

6 - tallest
Leisha

6 (Tallest) >>> Zina
5 >>> Weldon
4 >>> Delia
3 >>> Leisha
2 >>>Benito
1 >>>Charlotte

Solution
	•	Benito is not the shortest.
	•	From the 1st two bullet points, we know Zina, Delia and Weldon are taller than Leisha and Benito. And Leisha is taller than Benito.
	•	We know Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina, thus Delia>Weldon>Zina in height order. 
	•	Charlotte must be shorter than Benito since no one else is and Benito cannot be the shortest.
	•	So the final order is Charlotte, Benito, Leisha, Delia, Weldon, and then Zina.
