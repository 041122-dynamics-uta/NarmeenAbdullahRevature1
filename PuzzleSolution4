6 (Tallest)	Zina
5	Weldon
4	Delia
3	Leisha
2	Benito
1	Charlotte


Solution
Benito is not the shortest
From the 1st two bullet points, we know Zina, Delia and Weldon are taller than Leisha and Benito.
We know Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina, so Weldon goes between Delia and then Zina (who is tallest).
Charlotte must be shorter than Benito since no one else it. Therefore, Charlotte is the shortest.
So the final order is Charlotte, Benito, Leisha, Delia, Weldon, and then Zina.
