Solution
	•	Blake does not like to kayak, rock climb or zip-line because he like to keep his feet on the ground at all times. Therefore his favorite activity is cooking.
	•	Oliver does not like to rock climb or zip-line because he is afraid of heights. That leaves kayaking for Oliver since Blake likes cooking.
	•	Since Abigail’s favorite activity is not rock climbing, the only choice left is zip-lining.
	•	Finally, the only available activity left is rock climbing for Rosa which complies with the rule that she has to use a harness for her activity.
