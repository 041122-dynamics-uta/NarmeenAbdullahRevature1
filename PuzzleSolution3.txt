George	0	1	0	0	0
William	0	0	0	0	1
John	1	0	0	0	0
Abe	0	0	1	0	0
Millard	0	0	0	1	0

Monday	John
Tuesday	George
Wednesday	Abe
Thursday	Millard
Friday	William


Solution
Millard’s birthday is on Thursday.
Through trial and error – left with 4 days. We know William’s birthday is after Abe’s and since John is 2 days older than Abe, we can assume that William, Abe and John all are separated by 2 days (since Thursday is taken by Millard).  Test John on Monday, Abe on Wednesday and William on Friday.
Therefore, left with Tuesday which is George’s birthday because it is as many days before Millard’s as William’s is after Abe’s.
