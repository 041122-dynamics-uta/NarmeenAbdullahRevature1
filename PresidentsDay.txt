George, William, John, Abe, and Millard have their birthdays on consecutive days, all between Monday and Friday.
	•	George’s birthday is as many days before Millard’s and William’s is after Abe’s.
	•	John is two days older than Abe.
	•	Millard’s birthday is on Thursday.

Monday >>> John
Tuesday >>> George
Wednesday >>> Abe
Thursday >>> Millard
Friday >>> William


Solution
	•	Millard’s birthday is on Thursday. Left with 4 days.
	•	We know William’s birthday is after Abe’s and since John is 2 days older than Abe, we can assume that William, Abe and John all are separated by 2 days (since Thursday is taken by Millard). Test John on Monday, Abe on Wednesday and William on Friday.
	•	Therefore, left with Tuesday which is George’s birthday because it is as many days before Millard’s as William’s is after Abe’s.
