#Now Pseudocode
#This is a Command Line Calculator using Bash
#As Follows:
#The user starts the bash script.
#The script welcomes the user
#The script presents the user with a menu that allows the user to choose between the options add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
#After the user chooses a calculation type, they are prompted to enter the two integers. This can be one integer at a time.
#After pressing enter, the result is presented to the user.
#The user can choose to exit the program or choose to make another calculation.

#Must allow the user to choose which calculation to make.
#Must get both integers from the user.
#Must create a different function for each calculation type and call each function to do that calculation.
#The calculation functions cannot print the result to the screen as this violates the single-responsibility principle (Weâ€™ll learn about this later).
#Print the result to the screen by calling a separate function called result.
#After the result is printed to the screen, you must present the user with the option to make another calculation or quit the program.
